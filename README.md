javascript 30 days challenge

I'm working on strengthing my practical skills in vanilla javascript these days without relying on any libraries or frameworks, 
so I have decided to make a 30 days challenge for me to create every day a vanilla javascript app for 30 days.

if I succeeded in finishing this challenge, I will try it again but with React js.

you can follow up with the updates of this challenge on my linkedin account

wish me a good luck! :)
